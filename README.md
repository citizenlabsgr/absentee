## 1. Check for absentee voting status

Maybe you've already requested to receive your ballots by mail. Let's find out!

Visit the [https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us) and look up your voter registration status:

Make sure to enter your **full legal name** and the ZIP code of your last registered address. When you submit that form, you should see something like this:

If your registration page indicates that you're on the **"permanent absentee voter list"** then congratulations, you'll all set!

## 2. Fill out the absent voter ballot application

Due to the passage of the statewide ballot [proposal 18-3](https://ballotpedia.org/Michigan_Proposal_3,_Voting_Policies_in_State_Constitution_Initiative_(2018)), all registered voters in Michigan can now request an absent voter ballot without needing to provide a reason.

A fillable PDF is available for download: [https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8716_8728-21037--,00.htm](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8716_8728-21037--,00.htm)

Either print, complete, and scan your computed application or use PDF software to insert a digital signature.

## 3. Email the signed application to your clerk

Find your local clerk's email address here:
[https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/clerk](https://mvic.sos.state.mi.us/clerk)

![Find Your Clerk](images/mvic-clerk.png)

Attach your **signed application** to an email similar to the following:

> Dear City Clerk,
>
> I would like to receive an absentee ballot for all future Michigan elections.
> Attached is my completed application I downloaded from the MI SOS website.
>
> Thanks,<br>
> \<Your Name>


They should reply to your email within a few days confirming it was received.

## 4. Confirm your absentee status

After your local clerk receives your request to vote by mail, it may take a few more days for that fact to be reflected on your registration status.

Repeat [step 1](#top) every few days until it shows that you've been added to the permanent absentee voter list:
